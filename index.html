    <h3>30 April 2015 - CS4!</h3>
        <p class="post">
            The time has come! We are resetting the server world as well as updating all of the mods, and adding a few new ones. If you are a server member,
            you can login to view the new mods list when it is released, and of course, if you want to join the server, now is a good time to apply,
            so <a href="/contact">shoot me an email.</a> The CS4 server is the <i>last</i> 
            server before we switch to a <a href="http://www.technicpack.net/download">Technic Pack</a> for the technic
            launcher, so if you aren't able to use the Technic Launcher, let me know.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This server will be an accelerated gameplay server, meaning, you will be started with some basic tools and resources to help you get
            past the early-game phase. (*cough*cough*Daniel*cough*).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you are a member of the CS3 server, we will have a vanilla 1.8.4 server online at the same address for the time until we have the 
            mods finalized. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

    <h3>19 April 2015 - CS2 Mods Resolved (Sorry!)</h3>
        <p class="post">
            I have finally, thanks to help of NateTheGreat, gotten the CS2 server back online with a somewhat stable mod set. The list of mods is available
            for members to download in the <a href="/serverinfo/user">members area</a>.

    <h3>5 April 2015 - CS2 Mod Updates</h3>
      <p class="post">

              - Random Afterthoughts<br/>
